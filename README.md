Problem encounterd:
- txt file values would get over rieded 
- problems in writing to the txt file 
- problems in accessing values from Student objects
- problems with readability

How I sovled these problems:

- How I fixed the txt fie vaules from getting overieded is by making an updated the the student object then re writing the entire 
text file using the Studnet arraylist to re-write it 
- How I soveled this problem was learning how Scanner worked and learning how to wrote and read from fhile using it 
- I fixied This proplblem but honelt yguess an checking I got reall luck with this. basically I just .get(indexofStudet).getName(indexofStudent)

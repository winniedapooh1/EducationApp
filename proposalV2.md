# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

EducationApp

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An app that allows student to improve their math skills

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will have a login ability so it can keep track of user progress. I will do this by making student objects. The software will be able to read from a text file filled with questions and then verify them with answers. I will also have different sort algorithms that will be able to sort through different student objects and make a leader board.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- user login
- user will be able to do math questions 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- user login
- user will be able to do math questions (enable a time limit)
- User will se where they rank 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- user login
- user will be able to do math questions (enable a time limit)
- User will se where they rank 
- Users will be able challenge other users to a two player mini game 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- I will just need to brush up on some java 
- revisit a couple of old high school projects
